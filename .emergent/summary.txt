The previous AI engineer meticulously transformed the Orgainse Consulting website from an MVP into a sophisticated lead-generation platform. The initial phase focused on UI/UX, Odoo API integration, and building interactive tools like the AI Assessment and ROI Calculator, alongside a regional pricing system. A major challenge involved deployment, with multiple attempts and platform changes (Vercel, Netlify, Railway) ultimately leading to a complete rollback of deployment-specific files to a clean, Odoo-free, and fully functional codebase. The engineer successfully removed all Odoo dependencies, transitioning lead management to direct MongoDB storage with email notifications. The work culminated in the start of implementing significant new features, including service card linking, detailed service popups, service-specific CRM tracking, Google Calendar integration for consultations, and an SEO-focused FAQ section. The process was iterative, responding directly to user feedback and troubleshooting persistent deployment hurdles.

The primary goal for Orgainse Consulting, an AI-native firm, is to establish a pixel-perfect, WCAG 2.2 AA compliant, and multilingual-ready website. This platform must effectively generate B2B leads across 7 global regions and 6 specializations. Lead conversion mechanisms include an AI chatbot, calendared consultations, a newsletter, and e-commerce functionalities.

Key implementations to date include:
*   **Core Pages**: Homepage, About, Services, and Contact pages with MongoDB integration.
*   **Branding & UI**: Adherence to a specific color palette, typography, AI-generated imagery, professional logo, and social media integration.
*   **Company Information**: Updated founding details (2025), branches in Bangalore/Austin, and global operations across five continents.
*   **Lead Generation Hub**: Replaced Global Compliance Ready with a Lead Generation Hub featuring a newsletter, AI assessment, and strategy sessions, all backend-connected.
*   **Design**: Advanced gradients, animations, 3D/glass-morphism effects, consistent lighter color gradients, content-adaptive card sizing, and business-aligned images.
*   **Legal & SEO**: Implementation of Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages, with meta-tag and keyword optimization.
*   **Interactive Tools & Pricing**: Fully integrated AI Assessment, ROI Calculator, and Smart Calendar tools, moved from header to homepage body. A region-based, PPP-adjusted pricing system was implemented, specifically scaling Indian prices into thousands.
*   **Backend Integration**: Previously, integration with Odoo SaaS 18.3 for CRM, Marketing, and Calendar was completed. However, this has been recently removed, and lead management now relies on direct MongoDB storage with email notifications, and UUID-based records for professional data management.

New features explicitly requested:
1.  **Service Card Linking**: Homepage service cards should link to corresponding sections on the Services page.
2.  **Service Popups**: On the Services page, hovering or clicking Learn more on service cards should open a popup detailing What the service will do, Why choose it, and What the customer will get.
3.  **CRM Segregation**: Clicks and inquiries on service cards must be separately registered in the CRM.
4.  **Google Calendar Integration**: All Book Free Consultation buttons should integrate with Google Calendar for customer booking convenience.
5.  **FAQ Section**: Addition of an FAQ section on the Services page, featuring high-ranking search volume questions with Orgainse Consulting-specific answers to persuade customers and improve SEO.
6.  **SEO Ranking**: All new features must contribute to increasing the website's search engine ranking.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively implementing several new features for the Orgainse Consulting website, focusing heavily on enhancing user engagement and SEO.

The current work revolves around:
1.  **Service Card Linking**: Ensuring that service cards displayed on the homepage correctly link to their respective detailed sections or popups on the dedicated Services page. This involves modifying the  component to add  or  functionality.
2.  **Service Detail Popups**: Developing a system where, on the Services page, hovering over or clicking a Learn more button on a service card triggers a popup modal. This popup will provide in-depth information, specifically detailing What the service will do to them, Why they should choose it, and What they will get from the service. This requires significant modifications to the  to define the popup component, manage its state (open/close), and populate it dynamically with service-specific content. The data structure for services is being enhanced to store this detailed information.
3.  **Service-Specific CRM Tracking**: Implementing a new backend API endpoint in  to capture and segregate clicks and inquiries originating from specific service cards. This ensures that CRM data provides granular insights into customer interest per service. The backend modifications include defining a new FastAPI route and associated logic to store this data in MongoDB.
4.  **Google Calendar Integration**: The engineer has just successfully called the  to get a detailed guide for integrating Google Calendar. The next immediate step is to implement this integration for all Book Free Consultation buttons across the site, making it easier for customers to schedule appointments directly.

The website's core functionality is stable and Odoo-free. The backend now manages leads directly in MongoDB with email notifications. The frontend handles regional pricing and displays all interactive tools. The codebase has been thoroughly cleaned of all previous deployment-related files and configurations, making it ready for a fresh deployment strategy. The focus is currently on the  file for frontend UI/UX changes and  for backend API updates and data handling.
