The trajectory details the iterative development and extensive debugging of the Orgainse Consulting website. Initially, the AI engineer focused on UI/UX, responsiveness, and integrating Calendly. A major part of the work involved migrating the lead capture system from a FastAPI/MongoDB backend to a Google Apps Script/Google Sheets solution, including Google Chat notifications. This migration faced persistent challenges: environment variable loading issues in the React frontend during Vercel deployment, and subsequent Google Apps Script deployment failures (returning HTML errors, not JSON) and CORS configuration problems. After multiple attempts to fix the Google Apps Script, the AI engineer made a critical decision to revert the lead capture forms to use the original, robust FastAPI/MongoDB backend. Finally, the AI addressed user-requested content changes on the website, which led to a browser/Vercel caching issue preventing the changes from reflecting on deployment, which is the current state.

<product_requirements>
The core product is Orgainse Consulting's AI-native website, serving as a lead generation platform. It was designed to be pixel-perfect, WCAG 2.2 AA compliant, and multilingual across 7 regions and 6 specializations, featuring standard pages (Homepage, About, Services, Contact). Key lead generation features include a Lead Generation Hub (newsletter, AI assessment, strategy sessions), interactive tools (AI Assessment, ROI Calculator, Smart Calendar, initially Google Calendar, then Calendly), and region-based pricing. Explicit improvements requested included responsive service popups, Calendly integration, SEO-focused FAQ, dynamic header/logo behavior, dynamic currency symbols, and contact updates.
The initial implementation of lead capture relied on a FastAPI backend with MongoDB. This was then migrated to a Google Apps Script-based multi-sheet system with Google Chat notifications. Due to persistent deployment and configuration issues with Google Apps Script, the lead capture system was ultimately reverted to utilize the stable FastAPI/MongoDB backend. Future plans also include the OrgAInse Command Center, a sophisticated on-premises, multi-tenant Business Intelligence tool with advanced security, patent-worthy features, local Ollama LLM integration, and cross-platform compatibility.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Custom CSS.
- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (for lead storage).
- **Serverless**: Google Apps Script (initially for lead capture, later abandoned for FastAPI).
- **Integrations**: Calendly, Google Chat Webhooks, Google Sheets.
- **Deployment**: Vercel (for frontend), Kubernetes (environment).
- **Build Tools**: CRACO (for React configuration).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>

-   ****: This is the main React component.
    -   **Importance**: Central to the UI and lead capture forms.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensively modified for mobile responsiveness, Calendly integration, AI-themed UI. All 7 lead generation forms were initially migrated to use Google Apps Script API. Later, all  calls to  were updated to include . Most recently, these forms were re-routed to use the FastAPI backend. Content updates were made to the homepage (4.9★ to 4.6★ rating, newsletter text changed) and spacing issues were verified as correct on the About and Services pages.
-   ****: Stores environment variables for the frontend.
    -   **Importance**: Critical for backend URL () and Google Apps Script URL ().
    -   **Changes Made**:  was added and repeatedly updated with new Google Apps Script URLs. Most recently,  was configured to point to the FastAPI backend as part of the pivot away from Google Apps Script.
-   ****: Main HTML entry point.
    -   **Importance**: React app's base HTML.
    -   **Changes Made**: A  object polyfill was added to address environment variable loading issues in the browser.
-   ****: Vercel deployment configuration.
    -   **Importance**: Defines build and deployment settings for Vercel.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initially created, then modified to fix  and  issues. Later simplified to resolve conflicts between old and new Vercel configuration formats.
-   ****: Google Apps Script code.
    -   **Importance**: Serverless backend for multi-sheet lead capture, dashboard updates, and Google Chat notifications.
    -   **Changes Made**: Repeatedly updated to include CORS headers, add/remove email notifications, fix invalid Google Chat icon names, and ensure all 7 lead types were handled. Ultimately, this script's functionality was superseded by the FastAPI backend due to deployment issues.
-   ****: New Python script.
    -   **Importance**: Provides a command-line interface to view leads stored in MongoDB.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to enable easy viewing of newsletter subscribers and a summary of all lead collections directly from the terminal.
-   ****: New HTML file.
    -   **Importance**: Provides a simple web-based interface for viewing lead data.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to offer a user-friendly way to access lead statistics and details.
-   ****: New Markdown document.
    -   **Importance**: Documents all methods for accessing and viewing captured leads.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to provide comprehensive instructions for lead management.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a persistent issue where recently implemented content changes to  (specifically, updating the client satisfaction rating from 4.9★ to 4.6★ and changing the newsletter signup text) were not reflecting on the Vercel-deployed website, even after redeployment. The AI engineer verified that the code changes were correctly present in the source files () and that they were successfully incorporated into the production build bundle. The diagnosis points to browser caching or Vercel deployment caching as the root cause, preventing the latest updates from being displayed to the end-user. The AI engineer provided immediate troubleshooting steps focused on cache-busting for the user to try, such as hard refreshing the browser and using incognito mode.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to get confirmation from the user whether the provided cache-busting solutions have made the content changes visible on the deployed website.
