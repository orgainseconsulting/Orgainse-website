The trajectory chronicles the development of two distinct products: an initial React/FastAPI website for Orgainse Consulting, and a conceptual OrgAInse Command Center on-premises BI tool. Initially, the AI engineer refined the existing website, addressing UI/UX, SEO, and integrating Google Calendar (later switched to Calendly). A significant portion of the conversation involved iteratively defining and documenting the OrgAInse Command Center, incorporating user requests for advanced security, patent-worthy features, local AI (Ollama), multi-OS compatibility, and dynamic pricing, culminating in a comprehensive product requirements document for a separate team. Subsequently, the focus reverted to the website, where the AI engineer meticulously fixed mobile responsiveness, implemented Calendly, resolved multiple JSX structure errors, centered service popups, and enhanced the UI with prominent AI-themed elements. The process involved extensive debugging and iterative refinement, ensuring the website was production-ready for Vercel deployment.

<product_requirements>
The initial product was Orgainse Consulting's AI-native website, focused on lead generation, requiring pixel-perfect, WCAG 2.2 AA compliant, multilingual design across 7 regions/6 specializations. Core features included a homepage, About, Services, Contact pages, a Lead Generation Hub (newsletter, AI assessment, strategy sessions), interactive tools (AI Assessment, ROI Calculator, Smart Calendar), and region-based pricing. Explicit improvements requested included responsive service popups, Google Calendar (later Calendly) integration, SEO-focused FAQ, a shrinking header, logo redirection, dynamic currency symbols, and contact information updates.

Later, the user envisioned the OrgAInse Command Center, an on-premises, multi-tenant Business Intelligence tool. Requirements evolved to include: exclusive Orgainse sales, patent-worthy unique features (e.g., Unified Local AI-BI Ecosystem, Zero-Downtime Patch Management, Local AI Business Intelligence Chat), robust 4-layer licensing security (Hardware-Based, Authentication Server, Encrypted Runtime, Legal Framework), dynamic pricing (geographic, customer size, industry multipliers), local Ollama LLM integration, data compression, backup with overwrite, a patch/upgrade system, and cross-platform compatibility (Windows 11+, macOS 13+, Linux Modern editions).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the user's request to fix a button on the Contact page. This button, Schedule Free AI Consultation, was not connecting to Calendly. The AI engineer identified that the  component in  lacked access to the  function. The fix involved:
1.  Modifying the  component to accept  as a prop.
2.  Updating the React Router  for the Contact page in  to pass the  function to the  component.
3.  Adding the  handler to the Schedule Free AI Consultation button within the  component.

After implementing these changes, a production build was successfully created. The AI engineer then tested the Calendly button on the Contact page by navigating to  and confirming that the button was visible and correctly triggered the Calendly function upon a simulated click. This final fix ensured all consultation buttons across the website were correctly integrated with Calendly. The website is now considered fully functional and ready for Vercel deployment.
