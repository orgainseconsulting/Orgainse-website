The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the Orgainse Consulting website, starting with a founding date correction (2023 to 2025) and extensive documentation creation. A major phase involved critical SEO optimization, including canonical tags, sitemaps, and AI crawler enhancements. This phase introduced Vercel deployment and routing issues, particularly affecting the admin dashboard, leading to repeated 404 errors in production. The engineer meticulously debugged proxy configurations, environment variables (), and Vercel routing (, ). Subsequent attempts to fix SEO-related performance regressions led to design elements breaking. After several cycles of troubleshooting and user frustration, the AI engineer rolled back the problematic SEO components, restoring the core website design and admin functionality. The final state indicates the core application and admin dashboard are stable, though minor frontend issues persist, awaiting the next development cycle.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had completed a comprehensive set of testing for both the backend and frontend, aiming to restore the website to a perfect, stable state after several issues. The backend was confirmed 100% functional, with all 7 API endpoints working flawlessly. Frontend testing revealed that the Admin Dashboard was fully restored and working, including login, all 6 tabs, lead display, and CSV export functionality. The core website functionality (homepage, navigation, professional enterprise design, newsletter subscription, all API integrations, mobile responsiveness, and Calendly integration) was also confirmed operational.

However, minor issues were still present after this extensive testing:
1.  The contact page navigation was returning a 404 error, even though the contact form itself was functional.
2.  Certain service popup sections required cleanup, specifically the removal of forbidden sections.
3.  The API endpoints for the AI Assessment and ROI Calculator tools needed validation fixes.

The AI engineer made a final attempt to fix the contact page navigation and then provided a summary, recommending deployment and further testing by the user, while acknowledging these minor outstanding issues. The system is considered stable but with these known minor imperfections.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and fix the Contact page navigation returns 404 error by examining the React Router configuration and Vercel routing for the contact path.
