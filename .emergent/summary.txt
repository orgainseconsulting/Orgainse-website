The trajectory details a challenging development and debugging process for the Orgainse Consulting website, primarily focused on resolving persistent deployment failures and lead capture issues. The AI engineer transitioned the backend from Python to JavaScript serverless functions for Vercel, which proved problematic due to complex  configurations, environment variable loading inconsistencies, and MongoDB authentication errors. Repeated troubleshooting, often involving a dedicated agent, pinpointed root causes like hardcoded URLs in , incorrect  runtime specifications, and crucial MongoDB credential mismatches (password placeholders, cluster URLs, database names). Frontend JavaScript errors in AI Assessment and ROI Calculator forms were also identified and fixed. Towards the end, the engineer successfully implemented a refined lead categorization system, routing different lead types to separate MongoDB collections, and developed a tabbed admin dashboard for improved lead management.

<product_requirements>
The core product is Orgainse Consulting's AI-native website, designed as a pixel-perfect, WCAG 2.2 AA compliant, and multilingual lead generation platform across 7 regions and 6 specializations. It includes standard pages (Homepage, About, Services, Contact) and key lead generation features like a Lead Generation Hub (newsletter, AI assessment, strategy sessions), interactive tools (AI Assessment, ROI Calculator, Smart Calendar, Calendly integration). Initial lead capture used FastAPI/MongoDB, then Google Apps Script (abandoned), and now Vercel Serverless Functions with MongoDB Atlas.

Explicit user requests during this trajectory included:
*   An audit and update of all lead capture forms (Newsletter, AI Assessment, ROI Calculator, Service-based, Contact Page) to use new serverless functions.
*   Provision of specific MongoDB Atlas credentials for connection.
*   Fixing specific frontend errors in the AI Assessment and ROI Calculator forms.
*   Implementing separate lead capture for all types (Newsletter, Contact, AI Assessment, ROI Calculator, Consultation) into distinct MongoDB collections, with all six Service card inquiries grouped under one collection but identified by service.
*   Displaying these separated leads in a tabbed interface on the admin dashboard.
*   Clarification on how to change the admin portal URL to .
*   Guidance on where to locate and edit website content.
Future plans include the OrgAInse Command Center, a sophisticated on-premises, multi-tenant Business Intelligence tool.

**Key Files and Changes Summary:**
-   ****: Updated to route various s (AI Assessment, ROI Calculator, Service Inquiry, Consultation) to their dedicated MongoDB collections (, , , , ). The fallback database name was standardized to .
-   ****: Modified to aggregate and fetch data from all specific lead collections to support the tabbed Admin Dashboard. The fallback database name was standardized to .
-   ****:
    -   Integrated routing for the  dashboard.
    -   All API calls were refactored to use relative paths (e.g., ) to resolve  errors and CORS issues.
    -   AI Assessment form: Fixed  with null checks; added , ,  fields to meet API requirements.
    -   ROI Calculator form: Fixed  with a fallback array; resolved  by moving its definition; added , , ,  fields.
-   ****: Newly created to provide an interactive, tabbed interface for viewing and managing leads, categorized by type (Overview, Newsletter, Contact, AI Assessment, ROI Calculator, Service Inquiries, Consultations).
-   ****: Crucially configured for a React app with JavaScript API routes. It now correctly handles routing for both frontend SPA and serverless functions, includes Node.js runtime auto-detection, and addresses specific deployment and caching issues.
-   ****:  was explicitly emptied to force relative API calls in production, fixing persistent CORS errors.
-   ****: Contains the complete and corrected MongoDB Atlas connection string, including  username, encoded password, specific cluster URL (), and database name ().

-   Implementation of social media analytics, financial management, Royal Intelligence UI/UX, and F1 Knowledge Base for the Command Center.
-   Implementation of patch/upgrade system and advanced security features for the Command Center.
-   Addressing security vulnerabilities identified in  (hardcoded Google client credentials, weak secret key).
-   The user still needs to update the Vercel project name/domain for the main website and admin portal to  (which redirects to ) as per .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's feedback that while most lead capture forms were working, the AI Assessment Tool and ROI Calculator still had issues, and the lead organization in the admin dashboard was not as requested.

The engineer successfully implemented the following fixes and features:
1.  **AI Assessment Tool Fixes**:
    *   Resolved a  by introducing null checks on line 3055 of .
    *   Ensured the form submission included all required fields (, , ) to prevent  errors (e.g., Name, email, and message required).
2.  **ROI Calculator Fixes**:
    *   Addressed a  on line 3639 of  by providing a fallback empty array for potentially undefined data.
    *   Corrected a  by reordering the  variable's definition to occur *before* its usage within the  object in .
    *   Ensured the form submission included all required fields (, , , ) to prevent  errors.
3.  **Lead Separation and Admin Dashboard Enhancement**:
    *   ****: Modified the lead routing logic to direct submissions from AI Assessment, ROI Calculator, and Consultations to distinct MongoDB collections (, , ). All six service-based inquiries were configured to go to a single  collection, with the specific service identified within the lead data. General contact forms route to .
    *   ****: Updated to fetch and aggregate data from all these new, separate MongoDB collections to support a granular view.
    *   ****: Transformed into a tabbed interface. This new structure provides dedicated tabs for an , , , , , , and , allowing for organized viewing and management of all lead types. The Service Inquiries tab displays all six service types in one table with clear identification.

The AI engineer has completed these modifications and instructed the user to commit the changes and redeploy the application on Vercel to see the updated functionality and dashboard.
