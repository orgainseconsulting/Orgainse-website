The trajectory details the iterative development and debugging of an Orgainse Consulting website and initial definition of a OrgAInse Command Center BI tool. The AI engineer initially focused on website UI/UX, SEO, and Calendly integration, resolving issues like mobile responsiveness, uneven card sizes, and JSX errors. A significant part of the conversation involved designing a sophisticated Google Apps Script-based multi-sheet lead capture system with Google Chat notifications, replacing the existing FastAPI backend for lead storage. Recurring challenges included Vercel deployment misconfigurations (root directory, output directory), and the final critical issue identified: React frontend's inability to load environment variables (like ) into the browser runtime, preventing the lead capture system from functioning on deployment, despite local code correctness.

<product_requirements>
The core product is Orgainse Consulting's AI-native website, intended for lead generation. It requires pixel-perfect, WCAG 2.2 AA compliant, multilingual design across 7 regions and 6 specializations, featuring a homepage, About, Services, and Contact pages. Key features include a Lead Generation Hub (newsletter, AI assessment, strategy sessions), interactive tools (AI Assessment, ROI Calculator, Smart Calendar, initially Google Calendar, then Calendly), and region-based pricing. Explicit improvements included responsive service popups, Calendly integration, SEO-focused FAQ, shrinking header, logo redirection, dynamic currency symbols, and contact updates. Later, the OrgAInse Command Center was conceptualized as an on-premises, multi-tenant Business Intelligence tool with advanced security, patent-worthy features (e.g., Unified Local AI-BI Ecosystem, Local AI Chat), dynamic pricing, local Ollama LLM integration, data management, and cross-platform compatibility. The current implementation has moved lead capture to Google Sheets.

<code_architecture>


-   ****: This is the main React component. It has been extensively modified to include:
    -   Fixes for mobile/tablet responsiveness (Hero section, navigation, various sections, Our C.O.R.E. Values cards, The ORGAINSE Ecosystem cards).
    -   Integration of Calendly (replacing Google Calendar).
    -   Resolution of JSX structural errors.
    -   Centering of service popups.
    -   Comprehensive AI-themed UI elements.
    -   All lead generation forms (Contact, Newsletter, ROI Calculator, AI Assessment, Consultation, Service Inquiries) were migrated to use the Google Apps Script API endpoint, replacing previous FastAPI backend calls.
-   ****: Modified to support new AI-themed animations and effects, and responsive adjustments.
-   ****: A new component introduced to encapsulate Calendly booking logic, replacing legacy Google Calendar components.
-   ****: Modified to correctly center the popup modal and improve mobile responsiveness for its internal grid layouts.
-   ****: Important for storing environment variables. It has been updated to include  with the deployed Google Apps Script Web App URL.
-   ****: A new file to configure Vercel deployment settings, which required fixes for  and .
-   ****: This is a new file containing the Google Apps Script code. It acts as a serverless backend, routing different lead types from frontend forms to specific sheets in a Google Sheets workbook, updating a dashboard, and sending rich notifications to Google Chat via webhooks.
-   ****: New documentation detailing the setup process for the multi-sheet Google Sheets lead capture system.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was performing a deep dive to troubleshoot why the frontend changes (mobile responsiveness fixes and the Google Sheets lead capture system) were not reflecting on the Vercel-deployed website, despite working locally. The root cause was identified: the React build process is not correctly injecting environment variables (specifically ) from the  file into the frontend bundle. This results in the  error when  is accessed in the browser, rendering the Google Sheets API URL unavailable to the deployed frontend forms and preventing lead data capture and chat notifications. All frontend forms () have been updated to use  with , and a functional Google Apps Script () with Google Chat notifications has been configured and tested to work in isolation. The mobile responsiveness (e.g., The Orgainse Ecosystem cards) has also been fixed locally. The crucial blocker is the environment variable loading in the React build.
