<analysis>
This trajectory details the AI engineer's journey in enhancing the Orgainse Consulting website, focusing on critical fixes, new feature implementation, and extensive optimization. Initial work involved verifying previous fixes (AI Assessment, ROI Calculator, lead separation) and generating architectural documentation. Subsequently, the engineer implemented an Export All Leads feature and a secure admin login system, addressing frontend proxy issues. A major phase included improving security, SEO, and temporarily adding a blog system, only to later remove it and re-align images based on detailed user feedback. The final iterations concentrated on resolving Vercel deployment errors, refining SEO for first-page rankings, and correcting factual inaccuracies like the company's founding year, demonstrating an iterative, user-feedback-driven development cycle.

<product_requirements>
The Orgainse Consulting website serves as an AI-native, pixel-perfect, WCAG 2.2 AA compliant, and multilingual lead generation platform across 7 regions and 6 specializations. It features standard pages, a Lead Generation Hub (newsletter, AI assessment, strategy sessions), and interactive tools (AI Assessment, ROI Calculator, Smart Calendar, Calendly integration). The core problem is to optimize this platform for lead capture, security, and search engine visibility. Explicit user requests included auditing lead capture forms, separate lead storage in MongoDB, a tabbed admin dashboard with CSV export, a secure login for the dashboard, repository cleanup, enhancing security and performance to 100/100 scores, improving content marketing (initially through a blog, later removed), and comprehensive SEO for first-page rankings and generative AI discoverability. User also requested business-aligned images and correction of factual errors.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had completed a comprehensive SEO optimization, aiming for first-page search engine rankings and enhanced discoverability by generative AI systems. This included primary keyword optimization (AI Project Management Service, PMaaS for Startups), extensive structured data (Organization, Service, FAQ schema), optimization for AI crawlers, and local/global SEO strategies. During the final verification of these SEO improvements, the user identified a factual error: Orgainse Consulting was founded in 2025, not 2023, as stated in the SEO content. The AI engineer acknowledged this critical error and was preparing to correct the founding date across all relevant SEO content.
