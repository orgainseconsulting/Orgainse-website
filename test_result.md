These endpoints were previously working according to test_result.md history but appear to have been removed or not properly deployed as Vercel serverless functions. üìä IMPACT ASSESSMENT: Frontend forms for AI Assessment, ROI Calculator, and Consultation booking will fail with 404 errors, preventing users from accessing these critical business tools.

Tested multiple password encoding scenarios (URL encoded: Mycompany25%25MDB, raw password: Mycompany25%MDB, double encoded, Python URL encoded) - ALL FAILED with same authentication error. ‚ùå API ENDPOINTS FAILING: All MongoDB-dependent endpoints (/api/newsletter, /api/contact, /api/admin) return 500 status with 'bad auth : authentication failed' error. Only /api/health works (no MongoDB dependency). ‚ùå DATA OPERATIONS BLOCKED: Cannot create newsletter subscriptions, contact messages, or retrieve admin dashboard data due to authentication failure. üéØ ROOT CAUSE: MongoDB Atlas credentials (orgainse_db_user:Mycompany25%25MDB) are either INCORRECT, EXPIRED, or CLUSTER ACCESS is RESTRICTED. This is NOT an environment variable issue - the credentials themselves are failing authentication. CRITICAL ACTIONS REQUIRED: 1) Verify MongoDB Atlas user credentials in Atlas dashboard, 2) Check Network Access whitelist (add 0.0.0.0/0 for testing), 3) Verify database user permissions and roles, 4) Check if MongoDB cluster is paused or has connectivity issues, 5) Consider regenerating MongoDB user password.
