    message: "🔧 FINAL COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION - JSX STRUCTURE FIXES APPLIED: Executed final validation test covering all 8 critical deployment areas. PROGRESS MADE: 1) ✅ JSX Structure Issue RESOLVED - Fixed missing closing </div> tag at line 2029 causing 'Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for <div>' error, 2) ✅ Removed duplicate FAQ sections causing structural conflicts, 3) ✅ Fixed Services component structure with proper tag matching, 4) ✅ Page now loads with full content (JSX validation passed). REMAINING CRITICAL ISSUES: ❌ While JSX syntax is fixed, core interactive elements not rendering: Services navigation link missing, Learn More buttons missing, Calendly buttons missing, Mobile menu missing, Newsletter form missing. 🚨 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Deeper structural issue preventing proper component mounting/rendering despite JSX fixes. Page loads but interactive elements absent, suggesting routing or component lifecycle issues. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent should investigate component rendering pipeline and routing configuration."
