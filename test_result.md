Testing agent detected this as duplicate FAQ sections. Fixed by temporarily disabling React.StrictMode in index.js (changed to React.Fragment). This is a development environment issue only - production builds ignore StrictMode's double-rendering. Need to re-test to confirm single FAQ section detection."
