    message: "Completed comprehensive backend testing of all major endpoints including Google Calendar integration. All 6 Google Calendar endpoints are implemented and working correctly with proper authentication validation. Additional business logic endpoints (AI Assessment, ROI Calculator, Service Inquiry tracking) are also functioning properly with accurate calculations and data persistence. The OAuth flow initiation works, OAuth callback handles validation properly with CSRF protection, authentication validation is proper, and analytics integration includes Google Calendar booking counts. All core backend APIs (contact, newsletter, consultation) are also functioning properly. Backend is fully functional and ready for production use."
